<h2>Benefits of Honey</h2>
<div class="b-honey">
    <div class="richAnt">
        <h3>Rich in Antioxidants</h3>
        <p>Many of us enjoy honey and incorporate it into our daily diet, whether as a natural sugar substitute for our coffee or simply as a 
           sweet trest. But specific honey varietals known as "active" honeys have also been utilised throughout history for their antibacterial 
           and medicinal properties
         </p>
    </div>

    <div class="richAnt">
        <h3>Improves Cholesterol</h3>
        <p>Studies have shown that consuming honey lowers LDL (bad) cholesterol by 6-11% and lowers triglyceride levels by as much as 11%.
            Honey may also increase HDL (good) cholesterol by about 3%.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="richAnt">
        <h3>Natural Cough Medicine</h3>
        <p>Honey is a time-honored remedy for a sore throat. According to one study, it can also relieve coughs more effectively than OTC
            medications that contain dextromethorphan (DM), a cough suppressant. You can create your own remedy at home by mixing up to 2
            teaspoons of honey with herbal tea or warm water and lemon.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="richAnt">
        <h3>Improves Heart Health</h3>
        <p>It's high in antioxidants, such as phenolic acids and flavonoids, which may support beter health. Small studies in humans show 
            honey's antioxidants could help improve cholesterol levels, which could help decrease the risk for heat disease, although larger 
            long-term studies are needed to confirm those findings.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="richAnt">
        <h3>Lowers Blood Pressure</h3>
        <p> Blood pressure is an important risk factor for heart disease, and honey may help lower it. This is becuase it contains antioxidants
            compunds that have been linked to lower blood pressure. Studies in both rats ans humans have shown modest reductions in blood 
            pressure from consuming honey.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="richAnt">
        <h3>Antibacterial properties</h3>
        <p>Honey contains hyfrogen peroxide, which ay account for some of its antibacterial properties. It also has a high suger cpntent,
            which can help stop the growth of certain bacteria. Additionally, honey has a low pH level. This wrks to pull moisture away 
            from bacteria, causing the bacteria to get dehydraed and die off.
